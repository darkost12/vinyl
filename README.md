## My vinyl plates showcase

Base version is ready.

Improvements would be nice to have:
1. Show wiki & discogs buttons in info like it's done with previews;
2. Sorting by other parameters and orders;
3. Maybe refine filtering logic (now querying intentionally overrides tab and genre filtering);
4. Refine styling approach
